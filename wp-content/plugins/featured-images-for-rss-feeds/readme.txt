Adds featured images to your RSS feed, with image size & CSS positioning options. For use with Feedburner, Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Hubspot...

== Description ==

A simple way to add featured images in your site's RSS feed, with easy size and positioning options, and now supports custom sizes as well.

Works great with Feedburner, Mailchimp, Constant Contact, Hubspot, Infusionsoft, Feedly, or any other 3rd party RSS email, reader, or aggregation service. It is the perfect plugin for Mailchimp's superb RSS-to-Email campaigns, with the featured images added to the left or centered above the text, or to the left or right of the text with word wrap, and with thumbnail, medium, large, and full, as well as any custom sizes from the active theme. It's WordPress Multisite compatible, simply Network Activate to add featured images to all your site's RSS feeds, with each site having it's own size and positioning settings. It defaults to thumbnail sizes with left above text positioning.
